# Shadow-Dance-Game

Shadow Dance is a rhythm-based arcade game developed as part of my coursework at the University of Melbourne. The game draws inspiration from classic music games like Dance Dance Revolution, challenging players to hit the correct keys in time with the falling notes. The project was created using Java, showcasing skills in game development, object-oriented programming, and graphical rendering.

We used Bagel (Basic Academic Graphical Engine Library) which is a simple library for Java that uses LWJGL to present a simple game interface.
It is designed to be used for SWEN20003 at the University of Melbourne, with the complexities of using Java hidden from students.

* the music doesn't match up with the notes for now.
